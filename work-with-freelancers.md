# Finding Freelancers
## Where To Look

Elance/oDesk*
- If you’ve done any research into hiring a freelancer, you’re aware of the 800-pound gorillas of freelance marketplaces: Elance and oDesk. These are both great resources as you’ll find tons of freelancers from all over the world with a wide range of skills.

- These boards have great jobs that pay well. It may cost you a bit more, but it will be worth it to find the right person. Folyo is a similar board for designers. A quick search will reveal similar boards for various other areas of expertise.

Reddit’s forhire subreddit
- Freelancers can get better rates than the bargain basement jobs you overwhelmingly see on oDesk, but it’s not quite the caliber of Gun.io. The jobs here are often more interesting than something you’ll see on other boards.

## How Much To Pay

Freelance rates are all over the place. I talked to a startup recently who has been quoted between $9,000 and $750,000 for the same project. How can you even begin to evaluate what is reasonable?

## How To Choose

Even if you have the advantage of meeting your freelancer, it’s a good idea to give them a relatively small job for starters just to be sure you can work well together.Shave off a small piece of the overall project and give them that first. If the project can’t be divided, maybe find another smaller task you need done and let them have a go at that. Some people even invent a project they don’t need done just to make sure the freelancer will work out. It’s something of an insurance policy.
