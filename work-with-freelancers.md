# Ultimate Guide To Working With A Freelancer

Before you hire a freelancer, it’s good to understand what you’re getting into and how to navigate through the process with less frustration and uncertainty. If everything works out well, you’ll not only have the services you paid for, but also someone you can trust for future projects. This guide will include everything you need to know on hiring, setting expectations, and understanding your responsibilities as you work with a freelancer. Although some of the information focuses on hiring web developers, most of it applies when hiring any kind of freelancer.

## Finding Freelancers
### Where To Look

**organize by what you're actually looking for**

Elance-oDesk*
- If you’ve done any research into hiring a freelancer, you’re aware of the 800-pound gorillas of freelance marketplaces: Elance and oDesk. These are both great resources as you’ll find tons of freelancers from all over the world with a wide range of skills.

[gun.io](https://gun.io) & Authentic Jobs
- These boards have great jobs that pay well. It may cost you a bit more, but it will be worth it to find the right person. Folyo is a similar board for designers. A quick search will reveal similar boards for various other areas of expertise.

Reddit’s forhire subreddit
- Freelancers can get better rates than the bargain basement jobs you overwhelmingly see on oDesk, but it’s not quite the caliber of Gun.io. The jobs here are often more interesting than something you’ll see on other boards.

Local Communities
- If you can find where freelancers congregate locally, this can be an excellent source of help, particularly if you have need for someone to be on location. Just make sure you draw the line between needing someone on location and wanting someone on location. If you’re hiring a contractor for construction, you need someone on-site. If you’re hiring a web developer, you probably don’t. David Heinemeier Hannson, founder of Basecamp and creator of the popular Rails framework, says that, although it’s important to enjoy the company of co-workers in person, “[face-time is] far less important as a tool of getting things done.”

- Local freelancers can be found in meetup groups, chambers of commerce, business networking groups, and groups that provide support to entrepreneurs. Ask other business owners who they’ve used.

**Elance and oDesk are the biggest freelance marketplace representing the widest variety of skills. They sound like the perfect solution for all your freelancing needs, but it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.

When I first started looking for work, I watched postings on oDesk for potential jobs. I did this for a few months before deciding the signal-to-noise ratio was too low. I frequently saw postings asking for “Web developer, no more than $2.50/hour.” Obviously, these ads are targeting freelancers in developing markets, but these rates lower the overall perception of value for the services I’m trying to provide.

This scares away skilled developers who put a high value on their work. We can’t compete in that marketplace. Sure, if you hire this way, you’ll save a few bucks, but you’re going to have to overcome quite a few obstacles to get there. If you choose a contractor outside your region, will they be available to communicate when you are?

Imagine you wake up, review the work that took place on your project overnight, find a problem, and email a request for changes to the contractor. Your contractor won’t be able to deal with the problem until their next work day, and you won’t see the results until the following day. What if it still isn’t right? Can you afford that sort of overhead for every issue that pops up?

I have friends who specialize in on-shoring web development projects. All they do is take over projects that were originally built cheaply in developing economies. Most are now months behind schedule and well over-budget with plenty of work still to be done. Their clients bring them the work because they’ve found it’s simply easier all-around to deal with people in their region, even if the rates are higher.

That’s not to say Elance and oDesk don’t have great people from all different regions. They are out there, but they are constantly being squeezed by lower and lower rates. Some stick it out and some flee never to return.

--------------------

**Put Yourself in the Freelancer’s Shoes**

Try this on for size: If you’re going to write an ad for a job board like Gun.io, fight against your instinct to write a paragraph or bulleted list that tells potential applicants what you need. Instead, start the ad by telling what you will offer to the freelancer.

I get emails from recruiters fairly frequently. Some of them sound like they are written by people. Others start by telling me about their “requirements.” It’s probably not a great idea to get emotional about email, but this immediately makes me indignant. This person is insinuating their way into my inbox — uninvited — to tell me what they require of me. If you have any interest in staying in my inbox, you may want to come telling me what you’re going to do for me rather than what you “require” I do for you.

The job board scenario is obviously much different. If I’m at a job board, I’m going out looking for ways I might help someone else, but the principle is still useful because your ad is competing with other attractive ads that I may find more palatable. However, if you can step back for a second and think about what you’re offering the freelancer and frame your posting with that in mind, this will give you a distinct edge over most of the others who concern themselves primarily or only with what the freelancer can do for them.

Look at this the way you would look at marketing any other product or service:
- What are the advantages the freelancer will enjoy by working with me that may be unique? Does it pay especially well? Do you have tons of time to complete this project?
- What are the disadvantages of working on this project and how might I mitigate or address those? For example, maybe your organization is complex with many stakeholders in this project, but you have assigned someone internally to act as a single point-of-contact with the freelancer.
- Can I prove that I am easy to work with by providing a testimonial from a previous contractor? I’ve never seen anyone do this when posting a job, so you could seriously stand out if you did.

Complete this exercise and make it the first part of your ad. This will get your posting more attention and give you an edge over others in the marketplace.

--------------------

### How Much To Pay

Freelance rates are all over the place. I talked to a startup recently who has been quoted between $9,000 and $750,000 for the same project. How can you even begin to evaluate what is reasonable?

--------------------

**Set Your Budget**

Wait! Before you go any further, you need to have a good idea of your budget for this project. Most freelancers will ask you before they quote the project. The reason for this is that solutions to most problems can vary wildly from extremely simple to more complex and robust. We need to understand how much you’ll be spending so we can build a solution with that in mind. That doesn’t mean the solution will necessarily use up that entire budget. It’s also possible that all your requirements can’t be met within the budget. That’s a good thing to know early.

I understand the objection to this. If I don’t keep the budget a secret, the balance of power in negotiations tip toward the freelancer. This may be partly true, but the alternative is unrealistic. Imagine going to a realtor and asking them to help you look for a new house. They ask for your price range. You reply that you can’t tell them because then they will not care about getting you the best deal. You’d rather keep that secret until you find the right house.

What does the realtor do at this point? Do they show you the $50,000 house in the rural area that needs some work? Do they show you the $50,000,000 mansion in Beverly Hills? Maybe you’re doing well, but not that well, so a $1,000,000 San Francisco home is for you. Maybe you make a modest living, so a $200,000 home is where you top out. How many houses would the realtor need to show you before they hit exactly the right one at exactly the right price?

Now that you understand why, it’s time to make the budget. Call a meeting or several meetings. Bring in all the stakeholders and decide, before you start shopping for a freelancer, how much this project would be worth to your business.

--------------------

One approach is to evaluate pricing based on the effort you believe is being expended on your project. Talk to a friend with experience in software engineering to get an estimate. It might be worth your time to dive right into one of the introductory Thinkful courses so that you can get an idea what will be involved in your project. Once you’ve done this, you can probably ballpark a number of hours or at least get closer than you would have before. Some simple division will tell you what you’re paying hourly to complete the project.

Web developer rates in the US generally range from about $40/hour up to $300+/hour. That doesn’t mean you’re getting a great deal if you find someone less than that or that you’re getting ripped off if you find someone priced higher.  The low cost developer may not understand the value they’re bringing to the table. If this is the case, look for their rates to climb and stick with them when they do. The high cost developer may be faster, have better insights due to experience, or have a proven track record. Many high cost developers don’t even consider time or effort the most important factor in their rates. Maybe you shouldn’t either.

Evaluating your quotes in this way can be counterproductive. It assumes that the time and effort of the freelancer is what you want to buy. It’s better to think about the result you want from the service being offered.

An astute freelancer will realize this and change the conversation accordingly. They will dig deeper into your business, wanting to understand more than just your specifications for this project. They will want to understand how this project will impact your business and what other ways they could add value based on the way your business works. They will sell you on the results rather than on the process.

Imagine yourself in each of these two scenarios. You talk to a developer about a project. The developer seem capable and is interested. They quote you $10,000. You think the project will probably take about a hundred hours. The developer seems capable, so the rate of $100 sounds reasonable to you. You hire the developer who builds exactly what you asked for. You pay and everyone leaves happy.

Now, imagine you bring the same project to a different developer who is also interested in your business. That developer spends half a day with you getting to understand every aspect of your business. The developer suggests that you change the project spec in a couple of key ways. They show you examples of previous clients who have done projects in this way and the results they have had. 

Based on what the developer knows about your business and about the performance of these similar projects, you receive a ballpark ROI for this project of $30,000/year. This developer will do the project for $20,000. That’s twice the price of the first developer, but this new developer has already added value to your project by suggesting changes that will increase your return. They have also reduced your risk by showing you successful projects that have taken this approach. In doing this, they have changed the product they are offering you: instead of buying time and effort, you are buying a way to increase annual revenue by $30,000


### How To Choose

Even if you have the advantage of meeting your freelancer, it’s a good idea to give them a relatively small job for starters just to be sure you can work well together.Shave off a small piece of the overall project and give them that first. If the project can’t be divided, maybe find another smaller task you need done and let them have a go at that. Some people even invent a project they don’t need done just to make sure the freelancer will work out. It’s something of an insurance policy.

--------------------
**Planning As a Test Project**

One way to try out your freelancer while still producing useful work is to ask them to plan out the project. Brief them on the project and ask that they develop a solution for you. Wireframes, detailed descriptions of the way your customers will interact with the project, maybe even some detailed mockups of how it will look.

If the freelancer doesn’t work out for one reason or another, it’s likely you’ll at least have something out of their deliverables that will be useful to the contractor who ends up working on the project, even if it’s only a few ideas.

Take some time within your organization to fully define the problems you’re facing that have lead to this project. Answer these questions:
- What is the problem?
- Why is this project being pursued right now?
- What are the possible solutions we have considered?
- What is the budget? (See previous activity)
- When do we need it done?
- What are the effects of these problems on our bottom line? How much does it cost to live with these problems?

When you ask for the solution, share these insights with the contractor. This gives you a fast, low-cost way to do a dry run with a new freelancer that will be useful — no matter the outcome — in the final project.

Whatever you do, please don’t ask your freelancer to do speculative work or to complete a project for free with the promise of more work later. It’s disrespectful of the freelancer’s time. If you can’t afford to test the freelancer with a project and if the freelancer’s portfolio and references are not giving you confidence, it’s best to move on leaving everyone with dignity intact.

As mentioned previously, meeting in some capacity — be it online through Skype or Google Hangouts or in person — will help you figure out if you can work with this person. I’m sure I’ve turned plenty of people off my services just by being myself. This works out better for all parties. Why would we want to work together for six months or even just a month if we don’t get along?

Once you’ve found a freelancer you want to work with (and one who wants to work with you), it’s time to understand what it means to work with a freelancer. The expectations are nothing you can’t handle, but it’s worth noting the differences if you’re accustomed to working with full-time employees.

--------------------

## Expectations

Working with a freelancer can be jarring if you’ve worked only with employees. Instead of being the boss, you’re a client. You’re still setting the expectations for what the freelancer should accomplish, much as you would for an employee, but the logistics of working with a freelancer are slightly different.

Having the flexibility to work with freelancers can enhance the agility of your organization. You can quickly scale up to face whatever tasks are at hand. Take a moment to learn a bit about how you’ll pay for the project, how you’ll communicate with the freelancer, contracts, and invoicing, and you should have no trouble making the transition.

### Payment Terms

Payment terms can vary wildly based on a number of factors. Most projects will begin with a deposit of 50% of the total. Smaller projects may require full payment up-front. Extremely large projects may require a smaller percentage for the deposit. 

Other freelancers may charge for days or weeks of their time and require payment of a certain number of those to be made up-front. You’ll find nearly as many fee paradigms as you’ll find freelancers to come up with them!

If your freelancer charges a fixed project price, you’ll often pay the remainder at the end of the project. If it’s a long-term project that takes place over a few months, you may have payments at specific milestones. Your developer may divide the project into parts and require a payment after each part is completed, or they may simply divide the total estimated timeframe for the project and require regular payments until the end.

### Communication

You should hear something from your freelancer at least weekly while work is being done on the project. Here’s why: communicating is extremely difficult. As the client, you will do the best you can to convey at the beginning exactly what you want to your freelancer. Some of it won’t come out the way you envisioned it.

Sometimes, this will be because you didn’t explain it properly. Sometimes, it will be a simple mistake on the part of your freelancer. Other times, something between the two. Every time, it will be easier to fix if your freelancer is talking to you and showing you their work at shorter intervals. Work often builds upon previous work. What happens when the last three months of work was built on something that wasn’t quite what you wanted? It’s more expensive for your freelancer to keep in touch all the time, but it’s cheaper than revising months of work at every check-in.

The means freelancers use for communicating is all across the board. I deliver my clients a weekly video that shows off my progress and explains my decisions. I also share access to my project management software (Asana) with the client so they can see as I’m completing tasks. I use email and the phone, although I prefer the other methods.

Be sure to ask how your freelancer intends to keep in touch and how often you should hear from them before you sign the contract. Make sure this works well with your style. Maybe you want to be extremely hands-off and don’t mind seeing only the finished project at the end. ;)

### Contracts

Contracts can be scary. My contract is based on the Contract Killer which is a sample contract for freelancers. Read through this to get an idea of what you might see in a contract. It’s written in plain language, so it’s easy to see what the freelancer is trying to do here.

A freelancer wants to accomplish a few basic things with a contract.
- Establish what the freelancer will build for the client
- Establish what materials the client may be asked to provide to the freelancer
- Tell the client what they will own at the end of the transaction
- Set the amount of money to change hands and when it will do so

This is the part that trips clients up most often:

We’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we’ll license that you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise. We can provide a separate estimate for that.

It may seem like you’re losing something, when this reveals what you’re actually buying: a license to a web design. This keeps costs lower for the client since this is all most clients need. Do you really need to be able to re-sell your design to someone else for use on their site? Do you need to set up 20 identical sites in the same style? If so, make sure you negotiate that into the contract, but expect to pay more for it.

When your friend comes to you and says they want a web site like yours, I can be confident you’ll send them to me rather than breaking out the flash drive and making a copy of all the code and assets. You have the site you need and a great price. I’m able to continue building web sites to make a living. Everybody wins!

If you’re paying a fixed price for the work, your freelancer will probably define the scope of the project before work begins. This may be in the contract or in a separate document called the statement of work. Read this very carefully before you sign anything. It’s easy to be optimistic and think your freelancer will do whatever work is necessary to build the project you have in your head rather than the one on paper. Unfortunately, this is not a realistic expectation.

Review the scope knowing this is likely the most you will get from this transaction. After all, it’s the basis for the price you’re paying! If the relationship goes well over the course of the project, most freelancers will be happy — even excited — to make it easy on everyone to continue working together.

Whatever you do, don’t agree to a contract with anything in it that you can’t live with. In general, freelancers will want to be reasonable and want to make you happy, but the contract says what it does for a reason. If you don’t like it, ask for it to be changed. The worst that could happen is your freelancer doesn’t agree and you have to continue the search. Better than being saddled with terms you hate.

--------------------
**Lawyer Up**

If you haven’t already, form a relationship with a lawyer. Once you have a contract from a freelancer, it would be a good idea to have a lawyer take a look at it just to be sure you understand its full implications. 

If you’re not sure where to look for a lawyer, talk to other people who run businesses or check with local entities who support businesses and entrepreneurs like the local Chamber of Commerce.

--------------------
### Invoices

The invoice should tell you exactly how much you owe and when it’s due. It may also tell you how you can pay. I’m under the impression that most digital workers email invoices out now. This means you’ll get them quickly and it will be easier to pay, but they’re also subject to the pitfalls of email in general like false-positive identification as spam. Be aware of that if you haven’t gotten an invoice you expected to receive.

You can often pay with a check or with a credit card. You may even have a link directly on the invoice to pay with credit card just by clicking through and entering the information. If you can’t or prefer not to pay with a card, you should find an address for mailing a check. I like check payments because it’s cheaper for me to collect them, but I like credit cards because they are fast and easy. I’ve seen freelancers give discounts for non-credit card payments, but I’m not a fan of this practice.

Freelancers will also sometimes charge penalties for late payment. Those who prefer to offer a spoonful of sugar with their medicine may instead offer a discount for early payment. Regardless, it’s great practice to pay on-time or communicate when you can’t pay by the deadline. You’d be surprised how far this simple gesture can go.

Next, it’s important to understand all the responsibilities you’ll have as you’re working with freelancers.

## Client Responsibilities

Hiring a freelancer creates a relationship, and, just like with any other relationship, this one places certain expectations on both sides. If either side drops the ball, the relationship may not survive and the project might not be completed.

Just because you’re paying the bills doesn’t mean your responsibility ends there. Especially if you’ve chosen a freelancer who communicates frequently (which is probably best), you’ll need to provide a few things to ensure the project keeps moving properly.

- Clear direction for the project (i.e. scope)
- Feedback on progress
- Content to fill the site (unless that’s part of the service you’re paying for)
- On-time payment

As a client, if you consistently fail to fulfill your responsibilities, your reputation will suffer. Some freelance marketplaces provide feedback forums where freelancers will document your transgressions. If you’re working locally, you’ll be surprised how fast word about bad clients can travel.

### Defining Scope

You likely have a good idea of where you want to end up with this project, but you don’t know how to get there. That’s one of the reasons you’re hiring an expert. Project briefs can run the gamut from extremely vague to incredibly specific. Most of the spectrum is fine as long as you stay away from the extremes.

If you’re too vague, you’re far less likely to get what you want. If you can’t articulate it, how can your freelancer possibly build it? There’s no shame in taking an hour or two just to talk to your freelancer to get their opinion on what you’re trying to achieve. They probably know about some options you hadn’t considered. They’ll also know why some of your more pie-in-the-sky ideas are impractical. Be prepared to pay for this time. It’s just as valuable as the time they spent getting their hands dirty.

Go too far in the other direction, and you risk creating a different kind of relationship between you and the freelancer. According to the IRS, “...an individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done.” (emphasis mine) If the payer has control over these additional factors, “(regardless of what the relationship is called), you are not an independent contractor and your earnings are generally not subject to Self-Employment Tax.”

If you cross this line by telling your freelancer they can’t sub-contract out part of your job or that they should build your web site in Dreamweaver since that’s what everyone uses around the office, you may be on the hook to pay the employment taxes for that individual. If you want or need that level of control, you’re better off hiring an employee from the get-go.

### Feedback

Feedback doesn’t need to be elaborate. A simple, “stay the course,” is far better than nothing at all. The more detail you give, the closer you’ll see the project coming to your original vision. Don’t discount the value of push-back from your freelancer, though. You hired this individual for access to expertise you don’t have. It’s nice to know they’ll use that expertise to help you make the best decisions rather than just swinging the hammer whichever direction you say.

--------------------

**Put Your Feedback On Rails**

A good freelancer will try to guide your feedback. Before you give feedback, make sure you understand the scope of the feedback you’re being asked for. It’s hard to ignore any part of what you’re receiving from your freelancer, but, at the same time, if you get a photo of a drawing on a dry erase board, it’s probably not especially useful to comment that you wish it were another color besides white.

Your freelancer shouldn’t be finishing everything before you see any of it. That means you’re going to be seeing lots of bits the freelancer probably hasn’t even considered yet. Save your feedback on those until after they’ve been considered. You may find your concerns have already been addressed by the time that piece is complete.

Here’s an easy way to do this. First, write out all your feedback. Then, look at the feedback request from the freelancer to see what feedback is needed right now. Take any feedback you have that isn’t about one of those areas and save it. You may still need to give that feedback later. Deliver the remaining feedback to the freelancer.

Revisit these saved feedback items each time you’re asked for feedback to see if any of it applies on this pass. Once you get to the final pass, air any grievances that weren’t addressed in the interim. 

If your freelancer wasn’t clear on which parts they need feedback for, just ask.

--------------------
### Content

If you’re building a web site, it’s going to need text, images, videos, and other assets. Unless you’re paying the freelancer to come up with the content too, you’ll need to be sure they get it when they need it. A web site isn’t just a bucket you pour content into. The content will inform what your freelancer is going to build. You let this responsibility go at your own peril. The end result will suffer for it, and so will your freelancer!

--------------------

**Package Your Branding**

One of the most common pieces of content you’ll have freelancers requesting is your branding assets. This includes names, logos, and slogans that set your business apart from others. You might have several different permutations of your logo for different contexts or maybe you have brands within the overall brand that each have their own assets. If you’re really serious, you may want to develop branding guidelines that tell exactly how your assets should be used.

Pull all of this together now before you need it to make things move a little quicker when the time comes that you do need it.

--------------------
### Pay On Time

I’ve mentioned payment at almost every turn throughout this guide, but it bears repeating here as it is probably the most important responsibility. If the freelancer can’t get paid, they can’t keep doing what they love. If they can’t get paid predictably and on-time, it can cause all sorts of problems with their business. Quality freelancers may not work with you if you can’t pay on-time leaving you with fewer options next time you want to bring in outside help on a project.

## Conclusion

### You're Ready!

Armed with the how to hire, how to work with, and what your responsibilities are to your freelancer, you’re as prepared as you’ll ever be to hire a freelancer. You still don’t know everything, but, truth is, none of us do. Working with people is as varied and unpredictable as anything you’re ever likely to do. Even if you’ve been freelancing or hiring freelancers for years, you’re still running up against new challenges that keep you on your toes.

You’ll have to try it for yourself to learn the rest. Your experiences will be unique and will shape the wisdom you take away from the bargaining table and into the next freelancer you hire. You’re now better off than you were before reading this, but the rest is up to you!

As scary as the process may seem if you haven’t done it before, its just as scary from the other side of the table. Most freelancers are reasonable people just like you. They want to do a good job, make people happy, and fill their portfolios with great work. If you can reach terms with your freelancer around these mutually beneficial goals, you have a chance to make an ally who can be a partner to you in achieving your goals now and in the future.
